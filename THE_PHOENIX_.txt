alteration works :

1.) make a homepage with two internal webpages links- doctor's login and patient's login
2.) patient's login should be done with the qr code but the doctor's login should be done with protected credentials as it requires high security.
3.)doctor's login websage consists of the webpage - qr scanner and another link which when clicked opens the qr code generator link in the new tab.
4.) in patient's webpage the qr code when scanned the patient gets his reports with the prescription and medication details.



continuation :

1.)create a database to store every patient's details and records of entry and exit for doctor's safety
2.)create a online e-commerce to help the patients to buy the medicines by just using the qr code.


future :

try to replace the qr code with biometrics during entry/exit to doctor's hospital to ensure more feasibility and safety.
